    # AIAPSUP-Task-Sets – AI and Programming Task Sets

    This repository contains a comprehensive collection of task sets, assignments, lab tests, and associated resources focused on AI programming and practical AI-assisted development topics. It offers a combination of problem statements, Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and relevant documentation to support hands-on learning and project development.

    ## About the Project

    The project aims to provide structured, progressive exercises that cover a wide range of AI programming and software development skills. It integrates theoretical materials with practical coding tasks to enhance understanding and application of AI-related programming concepts.

    ## Contents

    The repository typically includes:

    - Assignments containing detailed problem descriptions and corresponding coding tasks in Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.  
    - Lab test materials with problem statements and solutions.  
    - Task sets organized for different modules or topics, each with notebooks and documentation.  
    - Supporting documents such as Word and markdown files describing tasks and providing instructions.

    The structure is designed to be flexible and extensible with new task sets and supporting materials added over time.

    ## Technologies Used

    - **Languages:** Python (primarily Jupyter notebooks and scripts).  
    - **Tools:**  
      - Jupyter Notebook environment for interactive coding and experimentation.  
      - Standard Python interpreters for running scripts.  
      - Document readers for `.docx` and markdown files for descriptive content.

    ## Getting Started

    To start using the materials:

    1. Clone the repository and change into it:
       ```
       git clone https://github.com/SdIshtiyaqAhmed/AIAPSUP-Task-Sets.git
       cd AIAPSUP-Task-Sets
       ```
    2. Open assignment or task set documentation to understand the problems or topics covered.  
    3. Launch Jupyter Notebook for interactive tasks or run Python scripts directly, adjusting paths as needed:
       ```
       jupyter notebook <path-to-notebook>.ipynb
       ```
       or
       ```
       python <path-to-script>.py
       ```

    ## Use Cases

    - Structured practice for AI programming skills and related computational tasks.  
    - Reference material for coursework or self-guided learning in AI and software development.  
    - Preparing and completing lab tests and assignments with detailed task descriptions and working solutions.  
    - Building a portfolio of AI programming exercises and projects.
